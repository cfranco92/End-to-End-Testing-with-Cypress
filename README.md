# What is End-to-End Testing?
To define End-to-End Testing it is necessary to first define other concepts:

## Testing: 
It is a process, a method of work, a tool, which is used to identify flaws in the software or product in order for it to reach an acceptable degree of maturity and stability before being launched.

## Testing pyramid:
According to the Testing Pyramid, there are several levels:

* Unit Test or Unit Tests: they allow testing the most fundamental elements of the software such as objects, functions, events, etc.
* Component Tests or Component Tests: they identify failures in components that include various internal functions or elements.
* Integration Tests or Integration Tests: they allow to test the behavior and possible failures in the interaction between the components with each other, and other elements of the software.
* GUI Test or End-to-end Tests: they allow us to identify flaws in the user interface. It is at this level of testing that we will focus on this course. It is the most elaborate testing that exists, because it depends on the other levels.

Some characteristics of End-to-end Testing:
* Test the entire software flow from the end user's point of view.
* Test the software from the user interface and not from the internal code.
* It is focused on detecting possible problems that our users may encounter in their interaction with the general flow of the program.
